- **`package.json`** - Added test scripts:
  ```bash
  npm run test:e2e          # Run all tests
  npm run test:e2e:ui       # Run in UI mode (interactive)
  npm run test:e2e:headed   # Run with visible browser
  npm run test:e2e:debug    # Run in debug mode
  npm run test:e2e:report   # View HTML report
  ```

- **`.gitignore`** - Updated to ignore Playwright artifacts

### Documentation

- **`e2e/README.md`** - Complete testing guide
  - Test coverage overview
  - How to run tests
  - Configuration details
  - Writing new tests
  - Troubleshooting
  - CI/CD integration examples

- **`e2e/EXAMPLES.md`** - Patterns and best practices
  - Common selectors
  - Wait patterns
  - Assertion patterns
  - Navigation patterns
  - Data extraction
  - Test structure examples
  - Error handling
  - Debugging tips

## Quick Start

### 1. Run All Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

This will:
- Automatically start your dev server
- Run all 45 tests across 3 browsers
- Generate an HTML report

### 2. Run Tests Interactively (Recommended for Development)
```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

This opens Playwright's UI mode where you can:
- Run tests selectively
- See results in real-time
- Debug with time-travel
- Inspect DOM snapshots

### 3. Run Specific Test File
```bash
npx playwright test e2e/cart-operations.spec.js
```

### 4. Run Tests in Headed Mode (See Browser)
```bash
npm run test:e2e:headed
```

### 5. Debug a Failing Test
```bash
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

## Test Statistics

| Category | Tests | Coverage |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Navigation | 7 | Homepage, header, footer, routing |
| Product Browsing | 7 | Listings, details, related products |
| Cart Operations | 11 | Add, remove, update, persist |
| Search & Filters | 11 | Search, category, price, sort |

## Architecture

```
e2e/
â”œâ”€â”€ homepage-navigation.spec.js    # Entry points and basic navigation
â”œâ”€â”€ product-browsing.spec.js       # Product listing and details
â”œâ”€â”€ cart-operations.spec.js        # Cart CRUD operations
â”œâ”€â”€ search-and-filters.spec.js     # Search, filter, sort functionality
â”œâ”€â”€ complete-shopping-flow.spec.js # End-to-end user journeys
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                      # Testing guide
â””â”€â”€ EXAMPLES.md                    # Patterns and examples
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Run the Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

### 2. Review the Results
Check which tests pass and which might need adjustment based on your specific implementation.

### 3. Customize as Needed
The tests use flexible selectors and should work with most implementations, but you may need to adjust selectors based on your specific DOM structure.

### 4. Add to CI/CD
Use the GitHub Actions example in `e2e/README.md` to integrate into your pipeline.

### 5. Extend Coverage
Add more tests for:
- Mobile responsive views
- Accessibility testing
- Performance testing
- Visual regression testing

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Failing?

1. **Check selectors** - Run tests in headed mode to see what's happening:
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e:headed
   ```

2. **Inspect with UI mode** - Best for debugging:
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e:ui
   ```

3. **Check API** - Make sure DummyJSON API is accessible

4. **Increase timeouts** - If tests timeout, increase wait times in the config

### Need Help?

- Check `e2e/README.md` for detailed troubleshooting
- Check `e2e/EXAMPLES.md` for patterns and examples
- Run with `--debug` flag for step-by-step debugging

## Test Execution Time

Expected run time (all browsers):
- **Chromium**: ~2-3 minutes
- **Firefox**: ~2-3 minutes  
- **WebKit**: ~2-3 minutes
- **Total**: ~6-9 minutes for full suite

Single browser (Chromium only):
```bash
npx playwright test --project=chromium
```
Run time: ~2-3 minutes

## Notes

- Tests are designed to be **flexible** and work with various DOM structures
- All tests are **independent** and can run in any order
- Tests handle **API latency** appropriately with proper waits
- **No external dependencies** beyond the DummyJSON API
- Tests follow **AAA pattern** (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Selectors prioritize **user-facing attributes** over implementation details

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the test output and error messages
2. Review `e2e/README.md` for common issues
3. Use debug mode to step through failing tests
4. Check Playwright documentation: https://playwright.dev

**Happy Testing! ðŸŽ­**
