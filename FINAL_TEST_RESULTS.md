## ❌ The One Failure

### Test: `should show product information to help customer decide`

**File**: `e2e/cart-verification.spec.js:74`

**Issue**: 
```javascript
const productText = await firstProduct.textContent();
expect(productText.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
```

**Error**: Product text extraction returned empty string

**Root Cause**: Selector might be grabbing just the link element without text content, or text is in a child element

**Impact**: Very low - this is checking product text display, but other tests verify products display correctly

**Fix**:
```javascript
// Change from:
const firstProduct = page.locator('a[href^="/shop/product/"]').first();
const productText = await firstProduct.textContent();

// To:
const firstProduct = page.locator('a[href^="/shop/product/"]').first();
const parentCard = firstProduct.locator('../..');
const productText = await parentCard.textContent();
```

## 💡 Key Insights

### What Works Great ✅
1. **All core shopping flows** pass perfectly
2. **Navigation** is solid across all pages
3. **Search and filters** work flawlessly
